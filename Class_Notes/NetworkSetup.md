# Network Setup


## Base Station

Name of the Device and hence the Local Network. Set a memorable, not guessable Password... do not leave it at the default.

_Allow setup over WAN should only be enabled when necessary_

Back to My Mac: you can log in via your Mac account. If the device is connected to the WAN (internet) it will be available for you to log in to from afar.

## Internet

For connecting to the Wide Area Network - WAN.  This is the way that the router connects to the internet.  Typically it would be through a cable modem, T1 line, or other Internet provider's device.  Using DHCP, it would be assigned an IP address on their network. This would then be able to be connected to from the outside world.

Connect using DHCP (dynamically assigned addresses), static (you set the IP Address), PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet is for non-dynamic internet connections - e.g. username & password, not dynamic connections)

IPv4 Address: 169.254.12.140
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Router Address: 192.168.0.254

DNS Servers: typically provided by your host
IPv6 DNS Servers: same but for IPv6 addresses
Domain Name: 
IPv6 Address:  Assigned if using

__Internet Options__

Configure IPv6 â€“ Link-local only, Automatically, Manually

use dynamic global hostname...?

## Wireless Tab

Create a wireless network, Extend a wireless network

Wireless Network Name: 

Wireless Security: None, WEP, WPA/WPA2 Personal, WPA/WPA2 Enterprise

how do you want people to connect?

__Wireless Options__
Region...

Create hidden network: Is not advertised and must be joined by name specifically

Radio Mode: a/c, n, g, b, a (in lowering level of quality)

Radio Channel: Automatic

## Network Tab

Router Modes: DHCP & NAT, DHCP only, Bridge Mode

DHCP Range: range of IP Addresses to assign to devices that connect

DHCP Reservations: IP addresses that are assigned to a specific device MAC Address e.g. 42:65:bb:21:0e:e6 => 10.0.1.201  (May also be assigned to a Device-Client-ID)

Port Forwarding: assigning any communication on a specific port to be sent to another port on a different IP address.  e.g. 10.0.1.30:7575 => 10.0.1.202:3000  This can be via UDP or TCP specifically and allows for public facing IPs & ports to be sent to private computers and Ports.

__Network Options__

Assign how long a DHCP address will be leased before having to be renewed. e.g. available for reassignment. You can also set the DHCP range of IP addresses

## Disks

If you have a USB port, networked drive, or an onboard hard drive, you can set up access here.
